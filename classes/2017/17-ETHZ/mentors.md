Duckietown is a project-based class. Projects
are done by groups of 4-5 students guided by a mentor.

Last year, at MIT, postdocs were employed as mentors,
to supervise projects in their specialty area. (And possibly
on their research.)

If you are interested in this, please discuss with your
supervisor if you can dedicate time to this, and then
contact [Andrea Censi](https://censi.science/).

In special cases, this is also available to very senior
Ph.D. students (last year).
