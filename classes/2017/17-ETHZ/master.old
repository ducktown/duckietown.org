This page lists the Master theses available related to
Duckietown. These Master's theses are to be performed at the
[Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control][idsc] under the
direction of Prof. [Emilio Frazzoli] and [Andrea Censi];
for the "interdisciplinary" theses, collaboration with other
labs is encouraged.

<p class='under-construction'>
Note: This page is under construction and only
a few of the Master's theses are described in detail.
Please check back by mid July to read the complete list.
</p>


These are the Master's theses available:

1. [**Design of a worldwide low-cost robotics education experience**](#design-low-cost) -
  an interdisciplinary, entrepreneurial thesis.
7. [**Scalable architectures for autonomy: from Duckiebot to a self-driving taxi**](#scalable).
2. **Optimal co-design of resource-constrained robots** - developed either as an interdisciplinary thesis in mechanical engineering/robotics, or as a theoretical thesis in applied mathematics.
3. **Vision-based SLAM under resource constraints** - a robotics robotics/vision thesis, can be developed more on the *algorithmic* side (focus on the implementation) or the _theoretical_ side (focus on models and theoretical prediction).
5. **Learning the rules of the road** - an algorithmic machine learning-focused thesis.
6. **Planning to learn and learning to plan**  - an algorithmic, with elements of machine learning-focused and robot planning and control
4. **Fleet coordination and management**: various topics available.

## Thesis: "Scalable architectures for autonomy: from Duckiebot to a self-driving taxi" {#scalable}

#### Motivation

Robots come in all shapes and sizes. And for each one, the software is created
ad hoc. The software created for a robot cannot automatically be made to run on
another different robot, even if the sensors, the dynamics, and the task  are
similar, because it depends on a set of **implicit** assumptions about the
resources available, the precision of the sensor, the noise in the process, and
so on.

Is it possible to create a scalable architecture that works on a wide range of
platforms? For example, can we create an "autopilot" that can drive the humble
$150 Duckiebot, a professional $10,000 go-cart, and a full-sized self-driving
car?
