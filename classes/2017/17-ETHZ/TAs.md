We are looking for teaching assistants for the [AMOD/Duckietown][amod] class.

[amod]: http://duckietown.org/classes/2017/17-ETHZ/index.html


### Role of Teaching Assistants

These are the expectations for the group of AMOD/Duckietown teaching
assistants as a whole:

- They will help us to create lecture materials.
- They will help us to create the robot setup instructions.
- They will help us create the programming exercises.
- They will provide technical assistance to the students during the class.

Note that all the materials created are going to be shared with the rest of the
world --- there are many more hundreds of Duckietown students outside of ETH
than there are inside! Moreover, they will eventually be published in a book
(the "Duckiebook").

### Profiles needed

We are looking for TAs with three types of background:

* "Software" - knows programming in Python (and possibly C++),
  knows Linux well, has experience with ROS.
* "Theoretical" - likes to write lecture notes and exercises.
* "Electronics" - has experience with embedded systems and electronics.


### Period and hours

Ideally, TAs should start on September 1 or earlier.

The workload will be between 10-15 hours per week during the term.

(If you wish, before the term starts, it is possible to work full time.)


### Pay / benefits

We pay the standard ETH rate - slightly below CHF 30 per hour.

As a bonus, each teaching assistant gets their own Duckiebot!

### Apply
