We also have _working positions_ available  for students, for a variable number of hours, starting in August (but later start is ok as well.)

These students will help preparing the experience for the class.

Some of the tasks include:

- preparing the equipment;
- testing the setup instructions;
- testing the robots.

If you are interested in this, please contact [Andrea Censi](https://censi.science/).
