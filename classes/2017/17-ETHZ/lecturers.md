Last year, at MIT, one of the collateral uses of Duckietown
was to provide an opportunity for postdocs to develop their
teaching skills. We had about 10 postdocs preparing 1 or
maximum 2 lectures on their specialty.

This is extremely recommended for postdocs preparing for an
academic career. Teaching is like swimming: you learn by
taking the plunge.

If you are interested in this, please discuss with your
supervisor if you can dedicate time to this, and then
contact [Andrea Censi](https://censi.science/).

In special cases, this is also available to very senior
Ph.D. students (last year).
