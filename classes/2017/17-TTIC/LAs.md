We are looking for Learning Assistants (LAs) for "Self-driving Vehicles: Models and Algorithms for Autonomy" (aka "Duckietown"). Note that we are specifically using the term "learning assistant" rather than "teaching assistant" because this role involves working with us to develop course material as well as extensive and regular interaction with students.

These are the expectations for the learning assistants as a whole:

- Help us create the robot setup instructions.
- Help us create the programming exercises.
- Help us with lecture materials.
- Provide technical assistance to the students during the class.

Note that all of the materials that we create are going to be shared with the rest of the world --- there are many more hundreds of Duckietown students outside of TTIC and UChicago than there are inside! Moreover, they will eventually be published in a book (the "Duckiebook").

We are therefore looking for LAs with two different backgrounds:

* Computational: knows programming in Python (and possibly C++), very familiar with Linux, has experience with ROS, etc.
* Theoretical: likes to write lecture notes and exercises.

As a bonus, each LA gets their own Duckiebot!

If you are interested in serving as an LA, please contact [Matt Walter](http://ttic.edu/walter).
