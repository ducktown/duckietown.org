We also have _working positions_ available  for students for a variable number of hours starting in August (but a later start date is ok as well). These students will help preparing the experience for the class.

Some of the tasks include:

- preparing the equipment;
- testing the setup instructions; and
- testing the robots.

If you are interested in helping out, please contact [Matt Walter](http://ttic.edu/walter).
