In the inaugural class at [MIT](http://duckietown.mit.edu), one of the collateral uses of Duckietown was to provide an opportunity for postdocs to develop their
teaching skills. We had about 10 postdocs preparing 1 or
maximum 2 lectures on their specialty.

This is extremely recommended for postdocs and research faculty preparing for an
academic career. Teaching is like swimming: you learn by
taking the plunge.

If you are interested in giving a lecture, please
contact [Matt Walter](http://ttic.edu/walter).
