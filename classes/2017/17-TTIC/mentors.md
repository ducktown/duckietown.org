We are looking for postdocs, research faculty, and senior Ph.D. students to serve as mentors for group projects, which are an essential component of the Duckietown course. This year, each group will consist of around 6 students, with two students each from TTIC, ETH Zürich, and the Université de Montréal.

If you are interested in being a mentor, please contact [Matt Walter](http://ttic.edu/walter).
